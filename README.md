Banks need to process high volumes of credit card applications. It would be time intensive, and error prone to manually process these applications. It is also critical that applications are properly approved and denied. Banks do not want to take on the risk of issuing cards to consumers who will default on their payments, but they also do not want to deny credit to consumers who would be good customers.

This project involves predicting whether someone will be approved for a credit card on the basis their application details. For this classification task, the goal is to build a function C(X) that takes as input the feature vector X and predicts its value for Y. The feature vector X is made up of 15 numeric and categorical predictors. Y is a qualitative response that takes values in a finite unordered set of approved or denied.
